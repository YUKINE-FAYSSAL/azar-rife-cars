# Flask Web Application with MongoDB and User Authentication

This is a web application built using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework, along with several additional packages to enhance functionality and ensure a seamless user experience. The application integrates with a **MongoDB** database for data storage, utilizes **Flask-Login** for user authentication, and supports dynamic form handling using **Flask-WTF**. The front-end of the project is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for a responsive and interactive interface.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - Users can sign up, log in, and log out using **Flask-Login**. Authentication is handled securely with session management.
  - Password validation and secure storage are provided.

- **Dynamic Forms**:
  - The application includes forms for user input, built using **Flask-WTF** and **WTForms** for handling form validation and submission.
  - The forms are dynamically rendered with **HTML**, and the user experience is enhanced with real-time validation and interactivity using **JavaScript**.

- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - The project uses **pymongo** to interact with a **MongoDB** database. MongoDB provides efficient document-based storage for user data, session management, and other application-related content.

- **Session Management**:
  - **Flask-Session** is used to store session data on the server-side, ensuring that user sessions are persistent across multiple requests.

- **Front-end**:
  - The front-end is designed using **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for styling, and **JavaScript** for added functionality such as form validation, dynamic content updates, and interactive UI elements.

- **Validation and Error Handling**:
  - Email validation is handled using **email_validator**, ensuring proper email format for user registration.
  - Error messages and validation feedback are provided to users when interacting with forms.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** (version 2.0.3): The main web framework that powers the application.
- **Flask-Dance** (version 7.1.0): For integrating OAuth-based third-party login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
- **Flask-Login** (version 0.5.0): Manages user sessions and login states.
- **Flask-Session** (version 0.3.2): Provides server-side session management.
- **Flask-WTF** (version 1.0.0): Simplifies form handling and validation.
- **Pymongo** (version 3.12.0 with [srv] option): MongoDB driver for Python.
- **Werkzeug** (version 2.0.1): A comprehensive WSGI utility library for Python used by Flask.
- **WTForms** (version 3.0.1): A library for handling forms in Flask with built-in validation.
- **Email Validator** (version 1.1.3): Validates email addresses using regular expressions.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flask-project.git
   cd your-flask-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - For **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - For **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Set up environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, secret keys for Flask-Session and Flask-Login).

6. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

7. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
